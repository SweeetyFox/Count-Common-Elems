# Count-Common-Elems
The goal of this project was to learn how to work with *GTEST* library.
So I implemented a **function**, which optimally **counts common elements in two std::vectors** and made some tests to ensure that it works correctly.

[Funtion's implementation](https://github.com/SweeetyFox/Count-Common-Elems/blob/master/count_common_elements.cpp)

[Tests](https://github.com/SweeetyFox/Count-Common-Elems/blob/master/count_common_elements.cpp)
